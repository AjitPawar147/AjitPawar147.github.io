  <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Ajit Datta Pawar</span></h1>
  <h3>Aspiring Data Scientist & Machine Learning Enthusiast</h3>

  <p>
    I am a passionate Data Science student focused on transforming raw data
    into actionable insights. I work with real-world datasets to build machine
    learning models, perform data analysis, and develop interactive dashboards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am enhancing my skills in time series forecasting, data
    visualization, and deploying data-driven applications using Streamlit
    and Flask. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in
    real-world industry projects.

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="section">
  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence
    and Data Science (3rd Year) with a strong passion for extracting insights
    from data and building intelligent, data-driven solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have hands-on experience working with real-world datasets and have practiced
    the complete data science lifecycle including data cleaning, exploratory data
    analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through academic projects, internships, and self-learning, I have worked on
    machine learning, time series forecasting, data visualization, and dashboard
    development using tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Streamlit, and Flask.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy continuously learning new technologies such as deep learning, NLP,
    and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and I aim to apply my skills to
    solve real-world business problems while growing as a professional data scientist.
